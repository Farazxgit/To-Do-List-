This is a to-do list app in which we can save our tasks which we have to do in future.
Once we complete them, we can mark them as "Completed" and we can remove then after it.
We are using Local Storage that will store the task list in your web browser, So that if you close and restart the browser, it will display your saved task List.![Screenshot (229)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c16398-3d4e-4b27-bbea-9ee69dd40e87)
